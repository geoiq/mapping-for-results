      <h2>About the Extractive Industries Map</h2>
      <p>The Extractive Industries Map is an online, publicly-accessible, interactive mapping application focused on the extractive industries of oil, gas and 

mining. With this tool, users can map the locations of mineral, oil and gas deposits, active mines, oil and gas wells, socioeconomic indicators such as 

unemployment and malnutrition rates, government revenues, and donor-funded projects. The goal is to create a tool that advocates and policy-makers can use 

to understand governance issues in the extractive industries and advocate for solutions. The platform was piloted in in Ghana and is designed to scale up 

easily to accommodate other countries and datasets as the demand arises. By allowing users to create their own maps of this information, the relationships 

between extractive activities, socioeconomic and other governance-related data can be better explored and understood than through the sole use of tables 

and text, and provides a central space through which a variety of information can be accesssed. </p>

<h4>Data Sources</h4>
<p>Various data sources were used to creating the extractive industries map. These individual sources and the way the data were processed to create the 

mapped information is described below. Wherever possible, links to the original sources are provided. As additional updates and additions are made, they 

will be recorded here as well.</p>

<h3>Minerals and Mining Data</h3>
<p>Information about the industrial mines in Ghana and the locations of mineral occurrences came from multiple sources.</p>
<h2>Industrial Mine Data</h2>
<p>The locations of industrial mines were identified using company declarations and Google Earth to locate the approximate coordinates of the mine. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://eiti.org/">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative </a> (EITI) reports provided on the <a 

href="http://www.geiti.gov.gh/site/">Ghana EITI website</a> were the source of the following information: royalty, tax and fee payments by mining 

companies; reported government receipts of royalty, tax and fee payments; disbursements owed to districts by the central government from mineral 

royalties; reported disbursements received by districts. Ghana EITI has only released reports for the years 2004 to 2008. As the most current district 

boundaries are not yet available the EITI data reported for Tarkwa Municipal district and the Prestea/Huni Valley district are combined and reported 

together as the Wassa West district, while the data for Obuasi Municipal district is reported as Adansi West district.</p>
<p>Gold production data was provided in a Ghana <a href="http://www.ghana-

mining.org/ghanaims/Institutions/GeologicalSurveyDepartmentGSD/tabid/156/Default.aspx">Geological Survey Department</a> report titled Performance of the 

Mining Industry in 2009. Data from 2010 on gold, bauxite and managanese production were provided by the <a href="http://www.ghana-

mining.org/ghanaims/Institutions/MineralsCommissionMC/tabid/155/Default.aspx">Ghana Minerals Commission</a>. They are included in the total production summations, but are not reported separately.
</p><p>Employment data were provided by the <a href="http://www.ghana-mining.org/ghanaims/Institutions/MineralsCommissionMC/tabid/155/Default.aspx">Ghana 

Minerals Commission</a>. The mapped values are the yearly averages of monthly employment levels for 2010 reported to the Minerals Commission  by each 

mining company. National service staff, trainees, expatriate staff, and local staff were included, but contractors were excluded as some companies did not 

report this information. Data on indirect employment (i.e. construction workers) and induced employment (i.e. spending of staff wages on goods and 

services) are not available at this time. 
</p><p>Company names, website URLs and dates of entry into mining in Ghana were collected from individual company websites, when available. </p>
<h2>Mineral Deposit Location Data</h2>
<p>The point locations and types of mineral deposits were provided by the Ghana <a href="http://www.ghana-

mining.org/ghanaims/Institutions/GeologicalSurveyDepartmentGSD/tabid/156/Default.aspx">Geological Survey Department</a>.
</p>
<a id="oil"></a>
<h3>Oil and Gas Data</h3>
<p>The data on oil and gas in Ghana came from multiple sources. 
</p><p>Information posted on the <a href="http://gnpcghana.com/home/">Ghana National Petroleum Corporation</a> (GNPC) website and the websites of 

individual companies provided data on the extent and location of commercial oil fields; the presence of exploration wells; the presence of production 

wells; oil discoveries; the boundaries of oil lease blocks; the ownership stake of the GNPC in each oil block and well; the date work was initiated in 

Ghana; and the financial interests of the various companies in each oil block and well. 
</p><p>Oil sales and oil production values were collected from GNPC official statements and news media reports. The sale value of the GNPC’s first oil 

lift is the total received by the Bank of Ghana received on April 8th, as reported <a href="http://ghanaian-chronicle.com/news/other-news/ghana-earned-

112m-from-first-oil-lifting-2/">here</a>. The value of the sale was converted from U.S. dollars to Ghana Cedis using the April 8th average exchange rate 

reported by <a href="http://www.forexpros.com/">Forexpros.com</a>. Oil sale values were not available for the Saltpond field. Oil production values for 

the Jubilee field were taken from <a href="http://www.ghanaoilwatch.org/">Ghana Oil Watch</a>’s report on <a 

href="http://www.ghanaoilwatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1490:ghanas-crude-oil-export-was-4842-million-for-the-first-quarter-of-

2011&catid=6:ghana-oil-a-gas-news&Itemid=27">lifting schedules and reported lift amounts</a>, and represents the total amount lifted between the start of 

production in January, 2011, to the March 19th lift by Tullow Plc and E.O. Group. Oil production for the Saltpond field was taken from the GNPC’s <a 

href="http://www.gnpcghana.com/_upload/general/saltpondfield_sopcl.pdf">Saltpond Field – SOPCL petroleum agreement summary</a> posted on its website, and 

represents the total amount lifted between June 2003 and November 2008. 
</p><p>Where possible, links to petroleum agreements were compiled from the <a href="http://www.energymin.gov.gh/">  Ghana Ministry of Energy</a>'s 

Agreements page (under Tenders/Bids tab) or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Otherwise, summaries posted on the GNPC website were 

used.<a href="http://www.gnpcghana.com/activities/details.asp?expID=11">Petroleum Agreements page</a>.</p>
<a id="wbprojects"></a>
<h3>World Bank Project Data</h3>
<p>The locations of active World Bank-financed activities fall under 12 "lending" product lines. The dataset of financed activities is provided and 

regularly updated through the <a href="http://api.worldbank.org/projects">Open Data API</a>. Out of these, so far, 1264 activities have been mapped in 

Ghana as of Spring 2011 under the following product lines: IBRD/IDA, Global Environment Project, Special Financing, Montreal Protocol, GEF Medium Sized 

Programs, Guarantees, Debt Reduction Facility, and Carbon Offsets. Locations of mapped financed activities are as of February 8, 2011.
<a id="ifcprojects"></a>
</p><h3>International Finance Corporation Project Data</h3>
<p>The locations of and information about International Finance Corporation (IFC) projects specifically related to oil, gas and mining were collected from 

project information available at the <a href="http://www.ifc.org/projects">IFC’s project portal</a>.  The approach for identifying and coding IFC activity 

locations followed the <a href="http://maps.worldbank.org/about/methodology">methodology used by Mapping for Results</a> to geocode World Bank-financed 

activities. 
</p>
<a id="indicators"></a>
<h3>Development Indicators
</h3><p>A description of the two data sources used for development indicators in the Mapping the Extractives Industries platform are provided below, 

followed by descriptions of the indicators. 
</p><p>Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) were used for indicators of Malnutrition, Infant Mortality and Births Attended by a Skilled Provider. The <a 

href="http://www.measuredhs.com/">MEASURE DHS</a> (Demographic and Health Surveys) Project is responsible for collecting and disseminating accurate, 

nationally representative data on health and population in developing countries. The project is implemented by Macro International, Inc. and is funded by 

the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) with contributions from other donors such as UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, UNAIDS. 
</p><p>The Statoids website was consulted for population data. <a href="http://www.statoids.com/">Statoids</a> provides sub-national population data by 

first and second level administrative divisions for each country. 
</p><h2>Malnutrition 
</h2><p>Malnutrition prevalence, weight for age (% of children under 5): Prevalence of child malnutrition is the percentage of children under age 5 whose 

height for age (stunting) is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children 

up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the 

WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006. Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and 

Health Surveys</a> by Macro International. Catalog Sources: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World 

Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Infant Mortality</h2> 
<p>Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births): Infant mortality rate is the number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live 

births in a given year. Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro 

International. Catalog Sources: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Births Attended by a Skilled Provider
</h2><p>Births attended by skilled health staff (% of total): Percentage of deliveries attended by personnel trained to give the necessary supervision, 

care, and advice to women during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period; to conduct deliveries on their own; and to care for newborns. Source: <a 

href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro International. Catalog Sources: <a 

href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Unemployment</h2>
<p>Unemployment rate (percentage): The percentage of the population in each first-order administrative unit that were not employed in the 12 months prior 

to the survey. Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro 

International. Catalog Sources: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Population</h2>
<p>Population (count of individuals by second-order administrative unit): The estimated number of individuals living in each second-order administrative 

unit at the time of the 2000 Ghana Census. The administrative units used in this mapping were those that were current as of the 2000 census. Source: 2000 

Ghana Census (from <a href="http://www.statoids.com/">Statoids</a>).
</p><h2>Population Density</h2>
<p>Population density (persons per square kilometer): The estimated population density reported as the number of persons per square kilometer for each 

second-order administrative unit. This data was calculated by dividing the population counts reported in the 2000 Ghana Census by the area of each second

-order administrative unit. The area was derived from the Global Administrative Unit Layers spatial data using a Geographic Information System (see 

below). Sources: 2000 Ghana Census (from <a href="http://www.statoids.com/">Statoids</a>).
</p>
<a id="boundary"></a>
<h3>Geographic Boundaries</h3>
<p>The maps displayed on the World Bank web site are for reference only. The boundaries, colors, denominations and any other information shown on these 

maps do not imply, on the part of the World Bank Group, any judgment on the legal status of any territory, or any endorsement or acceptance of such 

boundaries. 
</p>
<h2>Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)</h2>
<p>Countries: Ghana (2005)</p>
<p>The <a href=" http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=12691">Global Administrative Unit Layers</a> is an initiative implemented by FAO 

within the <a href=" http://www.foodsecinfoaction.org/News/news_06_06.htm">EC-FAO Food Security Programme</a> funded by the European Commission. The GAUL 

aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable spatial information on administrative units for all the countries in the world, providing a 

contribution to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. The GAUL sub-national boundaries for Ghana were last updated 

in 2005, and do not include several changes made since then to the number and shape of second-order administrative units (districts) in the country.
